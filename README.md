## Development setup

### Nix

- If you have `Nix` and `direnv` installed, you know the drill.
- If you have `Nix` installed without  `direnv` use `nix develop`.

> Do not forget to commit your files to git, otherwise Nix will not be happy.

### Without Nix

Make sure to have `Node` and `pnpm` installed, see the [official documentation](https://pnpm.io/installation).
