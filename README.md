## Development setup

### Nix

- If you have `Nix` and `direnv` installed, you know the drill.
- If you have `Nix` installed without  `direnv` use `nix develop`.

> Do not forget to commit your files to git, otherwise Nix will not be happy.

### Without Nix

Make sure to have `Node` and `yarn` installed.

## Installation

Change into the *website* directory and run `yarn` to install Docusaurus.
